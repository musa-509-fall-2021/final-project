1. Abstract — The goal of this project is to provide emergency management and E-911 centers in Las Vegas, NV with an authoritative dashboard to inform dispatching procedure. The idea is to provide a resource that will dictate which fire stations or hospitals should be receiving dispatch calls to respond to emergency sitations. Secondly, city planners can also utilize it as a site selection tool to better identify areas such as green spaces or parking lots to identify areas with little to no emergency service access that could be permanently repurposed into hospitals/fire stations.
