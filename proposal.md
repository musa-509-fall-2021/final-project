## Abstract

A Chinese student Dennis who just graduated from University of Chicago, was shot dead near the campus On Nov 9th.  Chicago has appealed a large amount of people from all over the world because of its outstanding education resources and prosperity, but it is also recognized as one of the most dangerous cities in the United States. Shocked by Dennis’s misfortune, we wonder how people can find a suitable place in Chicago to live. Thus, we’d like to design an application which aims to provide recommendations for people who plan to buy or rent houses in Chicago. 

We choose indicators from three dimensions, respectively safety, transportation, and commercial places. Users can enter an address in the search bar, or click the neighborhood they are interested in on the list or on the map. After that, users will come to a webpage which contains the neighborhood’s information in the format of charts and maps. Maps are mainly used to show the spatial distribution of public transit stations, crimes, restaurants, and groceries.  And Charts are used to convey quantitative information such as the frequency of crimes. Our application will also highlight the safest and the most convenient community targeted for different people.
